# Generics and Why
Java implementation exercise that constructs a Generic classes without any use of Java collections.
Good practice for understanding implementations of different classes and data structures.

# ListQueue
Constructs an Abstract Data Type ListQueue with different methods. Acts like a normal queue (to users) but is backed by a LinkedList using a Node class

# ListStack
Behaves like a stack but is backed by a linked list using a Node class.

# Hashmap
HashMap that is backed by an arraylist of linked hash nodes.

Acts like a normal HashMap but just with a custom implementation. Practice makes perfect!
